IATI Website Tests
==================

This repository contains tests of the live websites.

Currently only the dashboard is tested.

| These tests are run by travis - https://travis-ci.org/IATI/IATI-Website-Tests
| We use tron-ci http://tron-ci.herokuapp.com/ to run this every day.
| Since travis is not designed for daily tests (rather for per commit tests) this causes some odd behaviour.
